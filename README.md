# hello-world

Hello there!

I'm Justin, a male and I like programming. The language I use often is JavaScript. 
I also code some Lua, a little bit of C and Java.
I mainly do Roblox games and Discord bots. Coding is fun.

Outside of my technology side, I'm just a normal high-schooler who lives an average life. I like playing online games, being with friends, watching movies and others.

Have fun here in my profile!
