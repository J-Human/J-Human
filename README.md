# About Me

Hello there!

My name's Justin, I mostly work on web and/or backend development.

I develop REST APIs, games, websites, chat bots, and mostly anything that seems good to me. I know quite a couple of programming languages:
* TypeScript,
* HTML,
* C++,
* Lua,
* Python,
* Kotlin,
 
And other things like Shell scripting, etc. 

I have or help develop some projects, like personal games, and J-BOT (Discord bot). I am experienced with various frameworks, including React.

Currently, I enjoy watching movies, travelling, reading books, gaming, social media (maybe), and programming. Sometimes I also try to create digital models.

I can sometimes be funny, as well as curious. I try to enjoy life the most and put effort in all my work. Probably a nerd. My birthday falls on October 19, which makes me a libra.

Making effort is what I try to do, needless to say, aside from other work I have. You can always reach me out in any platforms listed at the bottom of this doc. Did you know I have a bare [site](https://J-Human.github.io)?
