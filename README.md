# hello-world

Hello there!

I'm Justin (he/him), I like programming. The language I code often is JavaScript. I also code some Lua, a little bit of HTML, and C. I mostly program Roblox games, Discord bots and sometimes, websites (I'm learning Vue). My first project is J-BOT, which is a Discord bot. Oh yeah, I'm in high school, by the way.

For the most part, I'm interested in making (more) Discord bots, making new friends, and trying new things (even if they're odd). Also interested in easy programming languages that are similar to what I know.

I enjoy watching movies, chatting and playing games. You can reach me out through my Discord (`Justin ;)#2021`).

Have fun in my profile!
