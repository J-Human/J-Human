# hello-world

Hello there!

I'm Justin (he/him), I like programming. The language I code often is JavaScript. I also code some Lua, a little bit of HTML, and C. I mostly program Roblox games, Discord bots and sometimes, websites (I'm learning Vue). My first project is J-BOT, which is a Discord bot. Oh yeah, I'm in high school, by the way.

I enjoy watching movies, chatting and playing games. You can reach me out through my Discord (`Justin ;)#2021`).

Have fun in my profile!
