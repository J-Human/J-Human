# About Me

Hi there!

My name's Justin, I mostly work on web and/or backend development.

I develop REST APIs, games, websites, chat bots, and mostly anything that seems good to me. I know quite a couple of programming languages:
* TypeScript (and JavaScript),
* HTML, TSX/JSX,
* C++,
* Lua,
* Kotlin,
 
And other ones like Shell scripting, etc. 

Currently, I enjoy watching movies, travelling, reading books, gaming, social media (maybe), and programming. Sometimes I also try to create models.

I can sometimes be funny, as well as curious. I try to enjoy life the most and put effort in all my work. Probably a nerd. My birthday falls on October 19, which makes me a libra.
