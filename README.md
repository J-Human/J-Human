# About Me

Hello there!

My name is Justin. I work on backend development, open source, and an adequate amount of web (and frameworks like React/Vue).

I commonly use TypeScript, C++, and Python. I also know UNIX shell scripting, Git, and SQL for database management. I'm familiar with Linux (mostly Debian-based systems), and macOS.

I enjoy watching movies, travelling, reading books, and gaming.

I can sometimes be funny, as well as curious. I try to enjoy life the most and put effort in all my work. My birthday falls on October 19, which makes me a libra.

You can always reach me out in any platforms listed at the bottom of this doc. I also have a minimal [site](https://J-Human.github.io).
