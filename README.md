# About Me

Hi there!

My name's Justin, mostly a backend developer. I try my best to place effort in things I do, both IRL and whenever I'm online. 

I program Discord bots, Roblox games, websites, and mostly anything that seems good to me. I know JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX (when using React.js), HTML, Lua, and other minor ones. I'm mostly interested in learning languages that's similar to what I know. My first project would be this Roblox game, me and my friend made. My first *personal* project would be J-BOT, it's a Discord bot, make sure to check it out. Other than programming, I also know how to make models (mostly for personal use).

Currently, I enjoy watching movies/videos, travelling, reading books that give me useful information, gaming (Roblox, Call of Duty, etc.), chatting on Discord with friends or people I know, and lastly, coding.

I'm a person who is curious, who is shy (sometimes, not always), gets bored easily, who wants to have some friends, enjoy life (I guess), and explore the world. My birthday falls on October 19, which makes me a libra, in terms of Western astrology.
